# Introduction

With this repository, you will be able to build and train a complete Sentiment Analysis Pipeline using BERT.

The pipeline allows you to load, clean, and process raw text data, then fine-tune a pretrained BERT model for sentiment classification.

You will also be able to deploy the trained model for inference and perform online sentiment predictions on new text inputs and validate everything with unit tests.
